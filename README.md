    -   EMA (Exponential Moving Average)
    -   MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
    -   RSI (Relative Strength Index)
    -   PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator)
    -   SD (Standard Deviation)
    -   BIAS (Deviation rate)
    -   ROC (Rate of Change)
    -   K (Stochastic Oscillator %K)
    -   D (Stochastic Oscillator %D)
-   Preprocessing techniques:
    -   Cleaning database
    -   Normalisation
    -   Savitzky golay smoothing 
-   Dimensionality reduction technique:
    -   PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
